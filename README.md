# bioinf-cap-PCR
Bioinformatic processing scripts for PCR and capture enrichment sequencing

Both pipelines use Vsearch (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) to process raw reads and use blast and diamond for taxon assignment
They were used in the paper untitled "Enhancing DNA metabarcoding performance and applicability with bait capture enrichment and DNA from conservative ethanol" from Gauthier M., Konecny-Dupré L., Nguyen A., Elbrecht V., Datry T., Douady C.J., Lefébure T. (doi coming soon)

##R_scripts folder## contains R script used in both pipelines
##Resources folder## contains files essential to make pipelines work correctly
